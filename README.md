# 100-Prisoners-Problems
A simple simulation for the 100 prisoners problem. For details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem

Just out of curiosity to testify the conclusion of the 100 prisoners problem.
And the normal distribution on a small sample size (less than 100 reps by 1000 simulations) behaves as expected.
